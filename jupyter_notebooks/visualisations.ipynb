        "### A brief introduction to the history of snooker\n",
        "\n",
        "Snooker is a **billiards** sport developed in the late 19th century by British Army officers stationed in India. The term *snooker* was army slang for a novice. After early variations, a standardised ruleset (including the respotted black) was adopted in **1919**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 1920s, **Joe Davis**—an English professional—organised the first **World Snooker Championship (1926–27)** and then dominated the early era, winning **15 consecutive** titles before retiring unbeaten. Through these decades, snooker remained largely a club game with modest audiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sport’s modern boom arrived with **colour television in the UK**. To showcase the new medium, the BBC launched the one-frame TV event ***Pot Black*** in the late 1960s, proving snooker’s TV appeal and paving the way for extensive coverage of the **World Championship**, **Masters**, and **UK Championship**—the **Triple Crown**—which the BBC still broadcasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why early snooker was so UK-based\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Administration and venues** were UK-centred; since **1977**, the World Championship has been staged at the **Crucible Theatre, Sheffield**, anchoring the sport’s pinnacle in Britain. ([wpbsa.com][1])\n",
        "* **Broadcast economics** (notably the BBC) concentrated visibility and money in the **UK market**.\n",
        "* The **player base and champions** were overwhelmingly from the **UK & Ireland**, reinforcing a domestic core.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Non-UK world champions\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on definition, there are **five (modern era)** non-UK winners:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Modern era / since the Crucible era**: **Cliff Thorburn** (Canada, 1980), **Neil Robertson** (Australia, 2010), **Luca Brecel** (Belgium, 2023), **Zhao Xintong** (China, 2025). ([Wikipedia][2], [Sky Sports][3])\n",
        "* **Including pre-Crucible**: add **Horace Lindrum** (Australia, 1952). ([Wikipedia][4])\n",
        "\n",
        "Notably, **Brecel in 2023** became the first champion from mainland Europe, and **Zhao Xintong in 2025** became the first Chinese (and Asian) world champion—two non-UK winners in the **last three completed championships**. ([The Guardian][5], [Sky Sports][3])\n",
