# How has the professional snooker tour grown internationally since its height of popularity during the 1980s?

**This project** is a comprehensive data analysis tool designed to streamline data exploration, analysis and visualisation for snooker match results between 1982 and 2020. The tool supports multiple data formats and provides an intuitive interface for both novice and expert data scientists.

The project aims to analyse historical professional snooker data to understand how the sport has evolved internationally since its peak in the 1980s. I will be focusing on player demographics, tournament distribution and prize money trends.


## Dataset Content
* My dataset consists of 4 csv files
    * matches.csv
    * tournaments.csv
    * scores.csv
    * players.csv

* These tables are all related to eachother through the use of primary and foreign keys.

* These tables are big and contain a lot of rows.

* I plan to merge these tables into one master table, this will make it easier to analyse and gain insights.

* You can find the Kaggle link to this dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rusiano/snooker-data-19822020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>


## Business Requirements
* Describe your business requirements


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* My hypothesis is that the sport has grown globaly, due to the rise international players which has helped produce more tournaments outside of the UK making the sport more accessible for everyone around the world.

* To attempt to validate my hypothesis, I will look at the data trends over the 38 year period I have data for.

* I will look at:
    * The number of players internationally per season
    * The number of international tournaments per season
    * How the average prize money per tournament has been affected by this
    * The number of players reaching the latter stages of tournaments(Quarter-Final, Semi-Final and Final) and whether that has a knock on effect of more popularity in other parts of the world.

I feel that this data will give me a good insight into how the sport has grown globaly. 


## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
